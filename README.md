# Quantum-SVM

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is a type of Supervised Learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks in traditional machine learning. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane that separates different classes by maximizing the margin between them. SVMs have been successful in various domains, but their capabilities can be further enhanced with the integration of quantum computing principles.

Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) are an exciting advancement in machine learning that leverage quantum computing principles with the mathematical framework of classical Support Vector Machines (SVM) to enhance classification tasks. By harnessing the power of quantum entanglement and superposition, QSVMs have the potential to revolutionize various industries.
